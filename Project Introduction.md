# The-Capabilities-and-Limitations-of-AI-in-Mathematical-Proof-Generation

## Introduction


The convergence of mathematical and computational technologies has had a profound impact on the evolution of mathematical proofs. Computing has played a pivotal role in the advancement of mathematical research, beginning with the fundamental proof of the four-color theorem in 1976, when computers were first used to assist in verifying complex proofs. This role has continued to evolve, with the advent of modern online collaboration between mathematical communities. In light of recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly models like GPT-4, there has been a resurgence of interest in exploring the potential of these systems to contribute to mathematical reasoning and proof generation.

This report examines the evolving role of AI in mathematics, investigating the history of computer-assisted proofs, analyzing the current capabilities of AI, and engaging with the ethical considerations surrounding the impact of AI on mathematics. It emphasizes the potential and challenges of AI in fostering innovation and understanding in mathematics, thereby laying the groundwork for future exploration in the field.
